# binary_clock_avr
Binary clock on ATMega32A. This clock uses edge-lit acrylic panels to display the time in HOUR:MINUTE format. The time can be adjusted using the rotary encoder - push to enable time setting and turn clockwise/anticlockwise to set the new time, push again to disable time setting.

TODO: 

- Turn off display at bed time (Hardcode what bedtime is)
- Turn on all LEDs at sunrise (Lookup table required)
